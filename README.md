HGAlertView
===========

Custom UIAlertView with completion handler instead of delegate.

You can use HGAlertView instead of UIAlertView with all functionalities of UIAlertView, plus you can show with completion handler
to know the selected button index without delegate.
Its also very usefull if you have more than one alertView in same View, so you have to give tag to each one to handle them
in delegate methods. So you will not need for all of this when using HGAlertView
